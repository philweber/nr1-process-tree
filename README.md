# Process Tree

## Description

Process Tree is a simple process viewer inspired by Unixâ€™s `pstree` command.

Process Tree allows you to easily see the processes running on a host, and to inspect the CPU, I/O and memory used by a selected process.

## Usage

Select a host to see a hierarchical list of the processes running on that host. Select a process to view the CPU, I/O and memory usage of that process.
